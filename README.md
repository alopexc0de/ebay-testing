# ebay-testing
This is where I've been playing around with @timotheus's ebaysdk

A varient of this script is used for the process of importing data into an Odoo 9 ERP

There's a lot here that is bad and could use refactoring... This was one of the first big things that
I made in Python, and it clearly shows. Maybe I'll come back some day and put this into some objects.

The API has probably changed at some point since the inception of this script, so some parts may need
to be tweaked.
